# coprime number 
    x said to be coprime with n when GCD(x,n) = 1;

# EulerS Totient Function phi(n)
    phi(n) will return the number between 1 to n which are coprime to N

    # for prime number
    phi(prime) = prime - 1
    phi(prime ^ x) = prime ^ x - (multiples of prime till prime ^ x)
                   = p ^ x - (p^x / p)
                   = p ^ (x-1) * (p-1)

    # for any number
    An arithmetic function F(x) is called mulitiplicative if
        F(n*m) = F(n) * F(m) Where GCD(n,m) = 1;
